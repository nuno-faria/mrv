## Simulations

- The MRV collision probability based ($ar$) on the number of records ($n$) and concurrent writes ($w$) can be defined by the following mathematical formula:

    $ar(n, w) = \frac{w - (n -  n \cdot (1 - \frac{1}{n})^w)}{w}$

    The following graphs display how the $ar$ based on $n$ and $w$, and the necessary $n$ to reach some target $ar$, based on $w$. The first graph tells that as $w$ increases, $ar$ will increase for the same $n$; additionally, as $ar$ tends to 0, we will need an exponentially higher $n$. This last property is also evidently in the second chart, where decreasing the $ar$ from 5% to 1% requires exponentially more records than changing it from 10% to 5%; in this last graph it is also visible that to keep the same $ar$, $n$ grows linearly with $w$.

## Workers

#### Adjust algorithms
- Comparison between different adjust algorithms (binary, linear, and quadratic) in the number of records created and the abort rate generated. Uses the microbenchmark with a single product and 8 clients; 2 extra clients are added at 60s. The target abort rate is set to 5%. Linear is considered the optimal adjust algorithm, as it converges faster and is the most stable:

    |Number of records|Abort rate|
    |-|-|
    |<img src="./workers/adjust_algorithms_records.png" width="275">|<img src="./workers/adjust_algorithms_ar.png" width="275">|

- Evolution of the total number of records and the overall abort rate with variable load increases (with 2x, 3x, and 4x increases in the number of clients between 60 and 120 seconds), using the linear algorithm:

    |-|-|
    |<img src="./workers/adjust_linear_records.png" width="275">|<img src="./workers/adjust_linear_ar.png" width="275">|


#### Balance algorithms
- Comparison between different balance algorithms (all, random, minmax) in the balance time, percentage of zero-value records, throughput, and abort rate. Uses the microbenchmark with 64 clients and 64 products (with no initial stock):

    |Balance time|Percentage of zero-value records|
    |-|-|
    |<img src="./workers/balance_algorithms_time.png" width="300">|<img src="./workers/balance_algorithms_zeros.png" width="300">|

    |Throughput|Abort rate|
    |-|-|
    |<img src="./workers/balance_algorithms_tx.png" width="300">|<img src="./workers/balance_algorithms_ar.png" width="300">|

- Comparison of the effect of different number of records balanced in each iteration (K*2) in the minmax algorithm, based on the number of records per product; the cells represent the relative difference to the baseline (K=1) in terms of balance time and percentage of zeros (lower is better):

#### Window size
- Comparison between different windows considered when adjusting and balancing records, in terms of the abort rate and the time to iterate. The adjust worker runs every second (so a window of 100% adjusts the records updated in the last second) while the balance worker runs every 100ms (so a window of 100% balances the records updated in the last 100ms):
 
    |Adjust worker|Balance worker|

## Overhead

- Write and read response time overhead comparatively to the native using 1 client, 1 product, and a varying number of records per product, with PostgreSQL and MongoDB (microbenchmark):

    |Postgres write|Mongo write|Postgres read|Mongo read|
    |--|--|--|--|
    |<img src="./overhead/overhead_postgres_write_simple.png" width="150">|    <img src="./overhead/overhead_mongodb_write_simple.png" width="107.2"> |<img src="./overhead/overhead_postgres_read_simple.png" width="107.2">|    <img src="./overhead/overhead_mongodb_read_simple.png" width="107.2">

- Storage overhead based on the number of clients, using three different workloads: microbenchmark with only one product, microbenchmark with 100k products and a few hotspots, and TPC-C with one warehouse:

- Testing with variable *uneven* scales, e.g., uneven=1 means one 1-unit add for every 1-unit sub, uneven=5 means one 5-unit add for every 5 1-unit subs, and so on (microbenchmark with PostgreSQL Repeatable Read, 32 clients, 32 products):
